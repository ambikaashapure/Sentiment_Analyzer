True Happiness is something comes from deep inside. It comes from our hearts. Although we feel that material things or pleasures can make us happy, it is not true. A person who is wealthy may or may not be happy. However, a person who is happy is always wealthy.

Happiness reflects one’s positive attitude towards life. Such a person strongly believes that whatever happens is for good. Even if he fails in life, he or she doesn’t blame destiny for it. Also,  such a person doesn’t lose hope. He is always hopeful.

An optimistic person will always be happy. Moreover, such a person will be able to find pleasure even in the pain. Also, a happy person doesn’t depend on others or external factors to make him happy. He will manage to be happy even in the worst situations.

Thus, we can conclude that happiness is an internal factor. It can be achieved by self-realization. Only by seeking unity with the Almighty, can one find true happiness.
